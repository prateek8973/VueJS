Let's simplify the explanation of Vue Router:
What is Vue Router?

Vue Router is a tool used with Vue.js to help you create web pages that can change content without reloading. It's like turning your web application into a TV, where you can switch channels (pages) without turning the TV off and on again.

Why Use Vue Router?

Single Page Applications (SPA): Vue Router lets you build a SPA, where users can navigate through different parts of your application smoothly, without the usual page reloads. It feels faster and more fluid.

Bookmarkable URLs: Even though the page doesn't reload, users can still bookmark URLs or share them. Each "view" or "component" in your application can have its own URL.

Basic Concepts

Routes: Think of routes as paths or addresses. Each route tells Vue Router which page (component) to show when the user visits a specific URL.

Components: These are the different pages or views of your application. You create a component for each part of your application (like Home, About, Contact).

<router-link>: This is a special link used in your templates. When you click it, Vue Router will show the component associated with its to attribute without reloading the page.

<router-view>: This is a placeholder component where Vue Router displays the current route's component.

How Does It Work? - A Simple Example

Imagine you have a website with two pages: Home and About.

Install Vue Router: First, you add Vue Router to your project.

Define Your Routes: You tell Vue Router that when someone goes to /, they should see the Home page, and when they go to /about, they should see the About page.

Bookmarkable URLs: Even though the page doesn't reload, users can still bookmark URLs or share them. Each "view" or "component" in your application can have its own URL.

Basic Concepts
**Routes**: Think of routes as paths or addresses. Each route tells Vue Router which page (component) to show when the user visits a specific URL.

**Components**: These are the different pages or views of your application. You create a component for each part of your application (like Home, About, Contact).

`<router-link>`: This is a special link used in your templates. When you click it, Vue Router will show the component associated with its to attribute without reloading the page.

`<router-view>`: This is a placeholder component where Vue Router displays the current route's component.

How Does It Work? - A Simple Example
Imagine you have a website with two pages: Home and About.

Install Vue Router: First, you add Vue Router to your project.

1. Define Your Routes: You tell Vue Router that when someone goes to `/`, they should see the `Home` page, and when they go to `/about`, they should see the `About` page.

```javascript
const routes = [
  { path: '/', component: HomePage },
  { path: '/about', component: AboutPage }
];
```
2. Create Vue Router Instance: You create a Vue Router instance and tell it about your routes.
```javascript
const router = VueRouter.createRouter({
  history: VueRouter.createWebHistory(),
  routes: routes
});
```

4. Use the router
```javascript
const app = Vue.createApp({});
app.use(router);
```

5. Add `<router-link>` and `<router-view>` to your template
1. 
```javascript
<router-link to="/">Home</router-link>
<router-link to="/about">About</router-link>
```

  - Besides, We can also use the `{{ name }}` syntax to bind the value of the to attribute to a data property.
  
  - The `to` attribute of `<router-link>` is the path that the link should navigate to when clicked.
  
  - The content of the `<router-link>` tag is the text that will be displayed as the link.
  
  - When you click a `<router-link>`, Vue Router will show the component associated with the `to` attribute without reloading the page.
  
  - `<router-link>` also accepts parameters and query strings. For example, `<router-link :to`=`"{ name: 'user',` `params: { id: 123 }}">User</router-link>` will navigate to the `user` route with the parameter `id` set to `123`.

6. `<router-view>` is where the current route's component will be displayed
```javascript
<router-view></router-view>
```

7. Route Parameters: You can also pass parameters in the URL, like `/user/123`. Vue Router can extract these parameters and pass them to your components.

```javascript
const routes = [
    path: '/user/:id',
    name: 'user', // optional , it is used to identify the route by name
    component: UserPage
//set props=true if you want to pass the route params as props to the component
    props: true

];
```
Here `:id` is a parameter that can be accessed in the `UserPage` component.

8. `$route`: This is an object that represents the **current route**. You can access the route's parameters, query, and other information through this object.
    -`$route.params`: This is an object containing the route parameters. For example, if the URL is `/user/123`, `$route.params.id` will be `123`.

9. Redirects: You can redirect users to a different route using the `redirect` property in the route configuration.
```javascript
const routes = [   
    path: '/home',//old path
    redirect: '/' //new path, to be redirected here


```

**catchAll** property is used to redirect all the routes that are not defined in the routes array.
```javascript
const routes = [
   path: '/:catchAll(.*)', //catch all routes that are not defined
    redirect: '/not-found' //redirect to not-found page
```
10. Navigation: You can navigate programmatically using the `$router` object.
    - `$router.push({ name: 'user', params: { id: 123 } })`: This will navigate to the `user` route with the parameter `id` set to `123`.
    - `$router.push('/about')`: This will navigate to the `/about` route.
    - `$router.go(-1)`: This will go back to the previous page in the history.
    - `$router.go(1)`: This will go back to the forward page in the history.
    - `$router.replace('/about')`: This will replace the current page in the history with the `/about` route.
```javascript
//navigate to the user route with id 123
$router.push({ name: 'user', params}}: { id: 123 } });
//$router.go(-1) //go back to the previous page
//$router.go(1) //go forward to the next page
//$router.replace('/about') //replace the current page with the about page
```
